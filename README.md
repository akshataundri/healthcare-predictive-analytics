# 🩺 Healthcare Predictive Analytics  

This project focuses on applying **Machine Learning models** for predictive healthcare analytics.  
The goal is to assist in **early diagnosis** and **risk prediction** using structured medical datasets.  

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement  

Healthcare providers face challenges in predicting diseases early due to:  
- Large volumes of patient data  
- Noisy & imbalanced datasets  
- The need for interpretable predictions  

This project applies ML models to predict outcomes, compare performance, and generate **visual + PDF reports** for decision support.

## 📊 Dataset  

- Source: Public healthcare dataset (e.g., Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset)  
- Features: Patient health attributes (glucose, BMI, blood pressure, etc.)  
- Target: Binary classification (disease present / not present)  

## ⚙️ How to Run  

1. Clone the repo:  
   ```bash
   git clone  https://github.com/akshataundri/healthcare-predictive-analytics.git
   cd healthcare-predictive-analytics
2. Create environment & install dependencies:

    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate   # Linux/Mac
    venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
    pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run training:

    python src/train.py
4. Generate evaluation report:

    python src/evaluate.py
